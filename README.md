# Employee Attrition Prediction
The project is a bluechip hackathon that is based on building a model to predict whether a customer will be churned or not based on the provided features.
The whole process is described in the .ipynb notebook file [here](https://github.com/victorsomadina/Employee-Attrition-Prediction/blob/main/Employee_Attrition_Prediction%20(2).ipynb)

The dataset is strictly provided by Bluechip [here](https://github.com/victorsomadina/Employee-Attrition-Prediction/tree/main/Bluechip%20Data)
